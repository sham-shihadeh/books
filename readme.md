Summary - 
BOOKRA is a book website targeting young people who are starting to get into reading more often since it is so popular on social media. Since a lot of people are on social media, reading has become so popular and it became a "trend" if you are a reader.

The first page of the website in the Home page with an introduction about the website with some of my favourite quotes from books I have read. 

The next page is Browse page with multiple sections about different books for example, booker prize books and trending books. 

There is a book club page with a description of the club and a link to join.


The last page is where users can search up a book and they can get the book name, the authorâ€™s name and a short description about the book. This page uses the Google API to get the information about the books.

Issues - 
All the pages of the website perform their function properly and there is no major problems that might be a reason for it not work. Although, at the start of developing the website I was planning to use an image for the logo which i think is still being recognised in the console and giving me an error warning. 
Another thing that is giving me an error message is the JavaScript despite it performing all of its functions; I think the reason for this error is that the JavaScript is being loaded before the HTML code. 

Despite these two errors in the console the website works and performs what I intended to do at the start of the planning process.

Improvements - 
A thing that I would want to change and improve is the layout of the browse page to make it look more professional.

The page with the name book rating is the name of the search page; which would have been better if I changed it to match it's purpose.
